## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Queries


### What I learned

I learned how to use media queries to change the layout to fit a mobile screen. 


### Continued development

While doing this project, I learned that there is a lot I need further practice on. For example, the page is not very responsive. I was able to use media queries to get the page to look close to the mockup but there was just so much wrong with the final outcome. When you are decreasing the size of the page, the background with the text portion decreases. However the text doesn't wrap around it. I believe I tried to use rem for the font size but the text doesn't move when you resize wit so the text spills out of the background. It overflows. 

I wasn't able to center the background image even though I tried to so that it matched the mobile version mockup. There's still a lot that I need to learn with background images.

When it came to altering the border radius, I wasn't sure how to do that in one fell swoop with the image and the container for the text. So I had to alter the images border-radius first by choosing the sides that I wanted and altering them and then moving to the 
.body container and altering the sides I chose.

The button also was not responsive so that when the page was resized, the button didn't change to fit the page. It remained the full static width.
